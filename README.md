- What purpose do you want your portfolio to serve?
    - To supplement my resume for job-searching and showcase relevant skills for potential employers in a way not restricted by today's resume-constraints. I could also include sections to showcase other soft-skills that could make my stand out more competitively in relevant job-listings, such as my art, soundscape narrative and photography skills, with an on-site analysis/in-depth explanation of the design choices made to highlight any skills employers might be looking for.
- Who do you intend to be the site's primary/target audience?
    - Job recruiters/scouters in the job market looking for someone with computer-science skills and professionally-fluent in both English and Spanish.
- How do you imagine they will likely encounter the site?
    - From a link on my resume or QR code on a business card.
- Given your purpose, audience, and context, what do you want to convey with this site? What design choices will help you convey those things?
    - Since I'm job-searching in both Puerto Rico and the mainland US, I'd make the website have an option to be displayed in both English and Spanish.
    - Show a general idea of my moral values and experience in leadership by displaying photos of my participating in philanthropy work and leadership positions respectively.
    - Either showcase projects on the portfolio or link to the repository of relevant programming projects that showcased my skills and experience.
- What else do you think will be important in design considerations for your site?
    - Make it straight to the point yet also visually pleasing. I'm considering using more advanced styling techniques to show professionalism and experience with coding.
